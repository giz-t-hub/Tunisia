### National Vision, Strategy, Masterplan <a name="national-vision-strategy-masterplan"></a> 

Transport:
- National Transport Master Plan 2040 (NTMP 2040)

General:
- The National Strategy for Green Hydrogen development in Tunisia by 2050  aims to position Tunisia as a net exporter of GH2, targeting 6.3 Mt/year exports to the EU and 2 Mt/year for local use, focusing on green ammonia for the fertilizer sector. Key elements include a phased implementation plan, regulatory framework, infrastructure development linking Tunisia to the EUâ€™s Hydrogen Backbone, R&D initiatives, and a financing strategy to support a Just Energy Transition aligned with national decarbonization goals. https://www.energiemines.gov.tn/fileadmin/docs-u1/Re%CC%81sume%CC%81_strate%CC%81gie_nationale_MIME_Anglais.pdf

- Tunisia's "Water 2050" strategy aims to ensure sustainable water resource management amid climate challenges. Led by the Ministry of Agriculture, it focuses on securing water availability, promoting integrated water resource management, and supporting socio-economic development. The strategy emphasizes efficient use of surface water, soil moisture, and treated wastewater, aiming to enhance resource mobilization and optimize water use across sectors. https://mapafrica.afdb.org/en/projects/46002-P-TN-EAZ-004

### Studies and research papers <a name="studies-research"></a> 

- CO2 emissions reduction in road transport sector in Tunisia: This study uses a VAR model to analyze how fuel consumption, energy intensity, economic growth, urbanization, and fuel rates affect COâ‚‚ emissions in Tunisia (1980â€“2014). Energy efficiency and fuel rates are key to reducing emissions, supporting the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Findings can inform Tunisiaâ€™s transport energy policies. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032116309583?via%3Dihub
- Investigating the causal relationship between transport infrastructure, transport energy consumption and economic growth in Tunisia: This study examines the causal links between transport infrastructure (rail and road), transport value added, capital formation, energy consumption, and COâ‚‚ emissions in Tunisia (1971â€“2012) using cointegration, impulse response, and variance decomposition methods. It finds unidirectional long- and short-run causalities between these factors, highlighting the role of infrastructure in driving economic growth and informing policy decisions. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032115014069?via%3Dihub
- Public transport demand: dynamic panel model analysis: This paper analyzes the mobility behavior towards public transport supply in Tunisia, focusing on key variables affecting individuals' decisions to use public transport, using a dynamic panel model applied to twelve Tunisian Regional companies. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11116-015-9586-1
- Analysis of the Public Transport Efficiency, Productivity and Economies of Scale: The Case of Sfax â€“ Tunisia: This study examines the efficiency and productivity of public transport in Sfax, identifying shortcomings in service supply and advocating strategies to improve it, highlighting issues like scale diseconomies and slow productivity growth. https://intapi.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/eoik-2024-0004
- Efficiency measurement and determinants of the public transport industry in Tunisia: This paper uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to assess the cost efficiency of Tunisia's public transport sector (2000â€“2010) based on capital, labor, energy (inputs), and seats per km, turnover (outputs). Results show 4.7â€“43.6% inefficiencies under variable returns to scale. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-014-0232-5
